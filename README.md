# SC1015-Mini-Project

# Our Goal
we want to predict a viewer's liking of a new anime based on various factors such as producing company, genres, age ratings and number of episodes, etc. so as to improve viewer satisfaction

# Our Motivation
- With the wide variety of anime available, it may overwhelm viewers when choosing what show to watch. As such, our analysis helps to predict and improve viewer satisfaction.
- In addition, stakeholders in the anime industry may be motivated to have a data-driven approach to decision-making when it comes to the various factors which may affect viewership and hence enhance viewership ratings and maximise profit.
