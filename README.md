# SC1015-Mini-Project

# Our Problem Statement
We want to predict viewers' liking of a new anime based on various factors such as producing company, genres, age ratings and number of episodes, etc.

# Our Motivation
- With the wide variety of anime available, it may overwhelm viewers when choosing what show to watch. As such, our analysis helps to predict and improve viewer satisfaction.
- In addition, an average 13-episode anime can cost up to US$2 million to produce. Stakeholders in the anime industry may be motivated to have a data-driven approach to decision-making when it comes to the various factors which may affect viewership and market anime to specific audiences hence enhance viewership ratings and maximise profit, reducing risk of financial losses.
